You can easily start the compilation and the usage just by running the CMake\+List file with a proper version of CMake and then follow the usual steps. The sample application lets you record the screen with the audio or a portion of it, just follow the instructions.\hypertarget{md__home_pushz_dev_video_app_src_libs_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Usage -\/ library}\label{md__home_pushz_dev_video_app_src_libs_README_autotoc_md6}
The library start with the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classController}{Controller}}} object which needs at the creation step the audio device chosen (just look the previous instructions) and the video\+Url which is different from each operating system (on Linux system, the library can give you the name of the display just by calling the {\ttfamily Display\+Info.\+show\+Infos()} method). Moreover, a SRSettings parameter is requested, which is a simple structure which needs to be filled with all the information about the recording. After all of this you can easily start the capture with {\ttfamily start\+Capture()} methods and the recording process should be fine from that moment, just be aware of the possible exception that could be thrown by the method. From that moment you can {\ttfamily pause\+Capture()}, {\ttfamily resume\+Capture()} and {\ttfamily stop\+Capture()}. You can retrieve the file from the folder where your executable was running.
